I"‰<p>It wasn‚Äôt on our punch list but it still needed to be done. The windshield had a lot of chips and stains and one <strong>HUGE</strong> scratch. Today just seems the right time to change it out.</p>

<p>Ester was driving home from work two days ago when she saw a <a href="http://mikesautoglassfl.com/">Mike‚Äôs Auto Glass</a> van. What jumped out at her was the ‚Äú<strong>Specializing in RV Glass</strong>‚Äù. She called me and I jumped on their <a href="http://mikesautoglassfl.com/">website</a>. I filled out the online estimator.</p>

<p>Within an hour they called to get more information. I told them what we have, which always is a bit of a story. You can‚Äôt say it is a truck, and when you say school bus you must explain it is no long acting as a school bus. They said they would call back with an estimate.</p>

<p>Within a half hour they called back with what I thought was a good price to replace both sides of the windshield (<strong>$640</strong>). We set an appointment for Thursday between <strong>10</strong> and <strong>2</strong>.</p>

<p>They showed up on time and had the passenger‚Äôs side glass out within minutes.</p>

</p>

<p>Because the glass is flat they cut new glass right in the driveway. They used the old glass as a template. After the glass was cut they used a sander to smooth off the edges. The guy doing the work said he didn‚Äôt want to be filmed so we had to take pictures sparingly and in stealth mode.</p>

</p>

<p>He was able to remove the glass alone but he had to call for backup to install the new glass. They had to apply a <strong>LOT</strong> of pressure to get the new glass installed. I was glad I didn‚Äôt attempt this particular project myself.</p>

</p>

<p>The driver‚Äôs side glass came out easily. With two of them there it was much faster cutting the second pane of glass. Getting it back in was not any easier than the first one.</p>

<h2 id="we-can-see-clearly-now">We can see clearly now!</h2>

<p>In the end they were here for about <strong>2.5</strong> hours and they did excellent work. We now have beautiful, clear, clean glass. A skoolie windshield replacement is an excellent upgrade and definitely a job for a professional!</p>

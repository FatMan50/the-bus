I"/<p>We are normal everyday people. The kind of people no one takes notice of on the street. Maybe that is why we get such strange looks when we say we have a converted school bus.</p>

<h3 id="our-skoolie">Our Skoolie:</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Skoolie-Bus-1995-International-school-bus-conversion.jpg" alt="1995 International 3800 School Bus, 7.3 Turbo Diesel, Converted to a Skoolie" /></p>

<p>We have a <strong>1995</strong> International <strong>3800</strong> Thomas school bus. It has a <a href="http://www.powerstrokehub.com/t444e.html">T444E Navistar turbo charged engine</a>. This is basically the same engine as the <strong>7.3</strong> Ltr ¬†PowerStroke engines found in Ford trucks. The bus version of the engine uses a different crank shaft and a different water pump. Other than that most other parts are the same.</p>

<p>Our <a href="http://www.powerstrokehub.com/t444e.html">T444E</a> is rated to have a peak horsepower of <strong>184</strong> @ <strong>2200</strong> RPM and <strong>460</strong> ft-lb or torque @ <strong>1400</strong> RPM. The engine is electronically governed at <strong>2600</strong> RPM. This bus was one of the first vehicles to have a fly-by-wire throttle pedal.</p>

<p>The transmission is an Allison <strong>AT545&lt;</strong> automatic transmission. This is a <strong>4</strong> speed transmission and it was common in school busses and medium duty trucks. It does not have a locking torque converter, which means it always uses the transmission fluid to transfer the power to the wheels. The result is higher operating temps and no overdrive on the highway.</p>

<p>Between the RPM limit and the <strong>AT545</strong> transmission, the top speed of the bus is <strong>65</strong> MPH. It can easily keep up with traffic around town. On the highway (<strong>70</strong> MPH Speed Limit) we can keep pace, we actually pass a few people.</p>

<p>It is 10 feet tall and about <strong>35</strong> feet long, nine windows. Because this was a Navy bus, and never designed to carry children is has a slightly elevated roof. Which gives you an extra few inches of head room. A <strong>6</strong> foot tall person will find they have <strong>5</strong> or <strong>6</strong> inches of headroom.</p>

<h2 id="why-a-school-bus">Why a school bus?</h2>

<p>That is a fair question. We like the sturdy, heavy duty feel of a bus over a traditional RV. We like the utilitarian look and feel of a school bus. The iconic shape brings up nostalgic¬†feelings¬†for almost everyone. Converting a school bus also allows us to build the RV just the way we want it.</p>

<p>Over the past 20+ years we have not benefitted from the ‚Äú<em>American Dream</em>‚Äù of home ownership. We decided that it was not worth chasing a dream that was not really ‚Äú<em>our</em>‚Äù dream. Our desire was to live smaller, giving emphasis on quality and not quantity. We want to see more of America and to be a bit more adventurous, while still having our¬†own bathroom close by.</p>

<h2 id="plus-we-think-a-school-busiscool">Plus, we think a school bus¬†is¬†cool!</h2>

<p>Our Dream is to eventually live in the school bus full-time and travel around the country. That might be a ways off right now, but as they say, <em>‚Äúif you will it, it is no dream!‚Äù</em></p>

<p>We will¬†use this blog to chronicle our journey of converting our bus¬†into our home on wheels. Sharing our knowledge and what we do right and what we do wrong will hopefully be useful to someone. So <a href="https://thebusabides.com/contact-us/">ask us questions</a>, let us know what you think and maybe we‚Äôll have some fun along the way.</p>
